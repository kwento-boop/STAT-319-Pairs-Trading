# Pairs Trading
Pairs trading is a trading strategy that is used to enable profit from a variety of market conditions, whether that includes uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement. It observes how two correlated stocks perform, allowing for easy comparisons of performance between the two securities. When the correlation weakens, meaning that one stock goes up as the other goes down, the pairs trading strategy dictates that the trader should "short" the better performing stock and "long" the worse-performing one. 

The goal of this project is to conduct a simulation-based analysis of the pairs trading strategy, where we download historical stock prices from real companies and implement the strategy into R using that data. We will create visualizations of the stock prices and use historical training data in order to tune the trading strategy. From there, we will use a test data set and then determine the actual profits using that data set with pairs trading.
